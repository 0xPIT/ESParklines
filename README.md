# ESParklines
Nice sparklines for ESP8266, ESP32 on Arduino Framework.
*Note: Will not compile on AVR due to lack of C++11 compiler and no standard C++ library.*

### Description 
This library is very simple, it
- holds a buffer of any numeric data type of speficied size
- renders sparklines using a passed-in function to draw lines
- uses the line drawing function of your preferred graphics library (u8g2, Adafruit, ...)

### Example Usage
Create Sparkline with a buffer for `25` items of `uint16_t` and **pass in** your existing line drawing function. I use [u8g2]'s `drawLine()`:
```cpp
SparkLine<uint16_t> MySparkLine(25, [&](const uint16_t x0, const uint16_t y0, const uint16_t x1, const uint16_t y1) { 
  u8g2.drawLine(x0, y0, x1, y1);
});
```
This example uses a *lambda expression* (aka. 'closure' or anonymous / unnamed function: `[] ( <parameters> ) { <code> }`) to match the [function signature](https://github.com/0xPIT/ESParklines/blob/master/src/SparkLine.h#L37) of [u8g2]'s `drawLine()`. For the [AdafruitGFX] library, change to `tft.drawLine(x0, y0, x1, y1, myColor);`, if `myColor` holds your line color in the current function scope. The ampersand `[&]` captures scope, so your outside variables are available inside `{ }`.

Next, add data regularly, e.g. every minute upon sensor read, or `analogRead()`, etc. The data will be automatically scaled and automatically rotated (FIFO), once the buffer exceeds the specified number of items.
```cpp
MySparkLine.add(42);
```

Then, periodically display sparkline at 0x10, 50 pixel wide, 20 pixel high, e.g. from `loop()` like so:
```cpp
static esp8266::polledTimeout::periodicMs periodicSecond(1000);

if (periodicSecond) {
  MySparkLine.draw(0, 10, 50, 20);
}
```

### Dependency Information
This library depends on [FixedPointsArduino](https://github.com/Pharap/FixedPointsArduino). It will be automatically installed via PlatformIO.

To remove this dependency, redefine `num_t` to `float` or `double` and remove all occurences of `.getInteger()` in `SparkLine.h`.
